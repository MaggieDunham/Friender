# Friender
Capstone 
This is a capstone project in my Liftoff program through Launchcode. I am really excited to say that this is a service I have wanted for a while and I am thrilled to be able to create it myself. 
Friender is a website for women who want to attend an event in their city, but don't really know anyone who wants to go to the same event. This website will list events happening or happening soon and will show other users who are attending or interested in the event. Then she can invite or post her interest in an event. I am creating this for women to feel safe going to events, that might be at night, with another woman or women.
